 <div class="bio">
 I am currently the Arizona State Women’s Soccer beat reporter for the State Press, a student run media at Arizona State. I have also been a Women’s gymnastics beat reporter for the State Press. I joined the State Press in the Spring of 2017 and transferred to the Water Cronkite school of Journalism and Mass Communications in the fall of 2016 from Mount San Antonio College in Walnut, California. At Mt.SAC I was apart of one of the first student run media platforms, Sac,media, ever both community college and University level to switch from print to sole a digital platform at the time. I was both sports staff writer and editor while at my time at Sac.media covering all of Mt.SAC rich sports history. I also was a podcast co-host  and producer of the R&R Show with Elsie Ramos of the Los Angeles Times. I was born and raised in the Los Angeles and now live in Phoenix, Arizona.
