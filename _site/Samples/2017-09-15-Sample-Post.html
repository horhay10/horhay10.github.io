<p>Gumbo is a stew that may have originated in West Africa or
was a traditional stew of the Choctaws served over corn grits
and today is more known for being a dish in the state of
Louisiana in the 18th century. It consists primarily of a
strongly-flavored stock, meat or shellfish, a thickener, and
what Louisianians call the “Holy Trinity” of vegetables,
namely celery, bell peppers, and onions. Gumbo is often
categorized by the type of thickener used, the vegetable
okra, the Choctaw spice Kombo powder (dried and ground
sassafras leaves), or roux, the French base made of flour
and fat. The dish likely derived its name from either a word
from a Bantu language for okra (ki ngombo) or the Choctaw
word for filé (kombo).</p>

<p>
Regardless of the name origins, Gumbo can be made with or without Okra or Filé powder. The preferred method in the historical New Orleans variation is with a French dark roux. The flavor of the Louisiana state dish has its origin in many cultures.</p>
<p>
Several different varieties exist. Creole gumbo generally contains shellfish, tomatoes, and a dark roux, filé, or both. Cajun gumbo is generally based on a dark roux and is made with shellfish or fowl. Sausage or ham is often added to gumbos of either variety. After the base is prepared, vegetables are cooked down, and then meat is added. The dish simmers for a minimum of three hours, with shellfish and some spices added near the end. If desired, filé powder is added after the pot is removed from heat. Gumbo is traditionally served over rice. A third, lesser-known variety, the meatless gumbo z'herbes, is essentially a gumbo of slow-cooked greens.
</p>
<p>
The dish combines ingredients and culinary practices of several cultures, including French, Spanish, German, Filipino, West African, and Choctaw. Gumbo may have been based on traditional West African or native dishes, or may be a derivation of the French dish bouillabaisse, or Choctaw stew, but most likely all three dishes contributed to the original recipe. It was first described in 1802, and was listed in various cookbooks in the latter half of the 19th century. The dish gained more widespread popularity in the 1970s, after the United States Senate cafeteria added it to the menu in honor of Louisiana Senator Allen Ellender. The popularity of chef Paul Prudhomme in the 1980s spurred further interest in gumbo. The dish is the official cuisine of the state of Louisiana.</p>
